    <h1>What Movie Next</h1>

    <p>An Android app to keep track of movie recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Source code repository: <a
          href="https://github.com/chrisjan-work/what-movie-next">https://github.com/chrisjan-work/what-movie-next</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Concept</h2>

    <p>At a party or social event, someone recommends you a movie. <br />
      You write the title into this app, as you would do in a notes app. <br />
      The app automatically fills up the details: director, genre, actors, year, rating, etc. </p>

    <p>Some time later you are at home and want to watch something. <br />
      The app gives you a list of movies that you entered, which you can sort and filter however you want. <br />
      The app can choose one at random for you. <br />
      Once you've watched it, you can mark it as "watched" in the app. </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>Some years ago I started writing down a list of movies I want to watch some day. Classics, new ones, etc. <br />
      At first, it was a plain text document in my laptop. <br />
      Later, I started using a Google Docs spreadsheet, where I entered more details beyond title. <br />
      Recently, I was trying to think of a simple app concept that I could implement in my free time, for the purpose of
      showcasing my skills as Android developer. As a professional with more than a decade of experience, all my code
      from these years is property of my clients, and I have nothing to show.
      I came up with the idea of implementing the movie list as a standalone app, for portfolio. </p>
